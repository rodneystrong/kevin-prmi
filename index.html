        <p>
          Do you have equity in your home? Are you 62 or more years old and struggling in your retirement to make ends meet due to a heavy mortgage payment each month? If you answered yes, you could be one of the many who benefits from a reverse mortgage.

Reverse mortgages are entirely underutilized and promise seniors the option of having an income again without having to return to work so that you can enjoy your golden years in a financially stable position, even without retirement savings.
